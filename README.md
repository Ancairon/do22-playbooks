# do22-playbooks


To run the app `cd` into the vagrant directory, and do `vagrant up`. \
Ensure that the ip inside the `hosts` file is the correct one.

cd out of the directory into the root folder of the project and run `ansible-playbook playbooks/install.yml`. \

This will build the whole app with Docker.
